// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(11 + 11 = 22)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(22 divided by 2 is 22, making it an Even)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 5, 7, 2, 1, 4  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. 5 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 19 divided by 5 = 3.8
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers. smallest=1  largest=7
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(5 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 19 then divided 19 and 5 making it equal 3.8. 
The smallest number of my 5 numbers was 1 making 7 the largest number)
